[Functional Programming in Java](http://amzn.to/2F61g1h) can be a great introduction for those uninitiated with the functional programming paradigm and its benefits. It can also bring great value to more seasoned developers with experience in the platform. It showcases many of the Java 8 additions around lambdas and the Stream API. The book even includes an appendix with the existing [Functional Interfaces](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functional-interfaces-java/) in the JDK.  

The book also covers platform independent patterns that can help virtually every developer such as [Memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization), [TCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call), [Thread-Safe lazy initialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_initialization), and many more. Moreover, many of the patterns showcased in the book can be seamlessly ported to other platforms.
