Have you ever looked at a flier and felt that it was ugly? Or at an Apple billboard and felt that it was pretty? Do you feel like you can differentiate a good design from a bad one without knowing why? [Then this book is for you](http://amzn.to/2tn0ybe).  

[![The Non Designer's Design Book](/images/books/non-designers-design-book.jpg)](http://amzn.to/2tn0ybe)  

[The Non Designer's Design Book](http://amzn.to/2tn0ybe) is based around the premise that once you can identify a handful of design elements you'll be able to determine what is wrong with a design, and consequently correct it. That being said, the author recognizes the book is far from being a substitute to four years of design school.  

[Robin Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Williams_(writer)) did a great job conveying design expertise with the printed edition. The paper quality, the typography the colors, are just superb. **How do I know?** I read the book. _[Grin]_. Moreover, the book contains hundreds of good and bad design examples. As well as an extensive typeface reference.  

## Case study: [tddapps.com](/) redesign  

Being a software engineer by trade, my design expertise is limited to install [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). After reading [The Non Designer's Design Book](http://amzn.to/2tn0ybe) I was able to redesign this blog with minimal effort.

### Not impressed with the changes?  
**Strong alignment**: Everything in the updated version is aligned to the left. This makes the design dramatically better.  
**Contrast**: Article titles are clearly distinguishable. They have a different font size and color from the article summaries. The website name can be clearly differentiated as well as the newsletter signup form.  

## Summary  
Design is everywhere. Being able to identify good and bad designs can be a powerful skill for anyone. [The Non Designer's Design Book](http://amzn.to/2tn0ybe) is a concise and easy-to-read book that seamlessly educates its readers.
