Development teams have similarities and differences. These are my questions to gauge the maturity of a team based on certain parameters: Agility, Code Quality, Operational Integrity. Most of the questions don't have a single correct answer but a spectrum of possible answers. While far from being comprehensive this test can be useful when comparing potential employers and clients.  

# Questions  

- What is your source control branching strategy?
- How do you know what is your team working on?
    - What needs to be done?
    - What has already been completed?
- How long does it take you to go from an idea into something your customers can use?
- How frequently do you do deployments?
