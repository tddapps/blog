title: Tribal Leadership and why you should read it

First things first. I think the title of the book is misleading. This is not a business administration book. Moreover, it is far from teaching anyone how to be a leader.  

The book is a self-discovery book that gives names to common behaviors encountered throughout almost every workplace. And a very good one to be fair.  

The book answers *Why does it feel like:*  

- Every company has the same issues  
- It is very hard to fix broken processes  
- Perennial failure in spite of being constantly working  
- The people around can't be as good  

[Tribal Leadership](http://amzn.to/1olJJW6) categorizes these and several other behaviors into a set of five simple stages. Not only that, it provides tools to measure and increase the throughput of your organization.  

I don't want to give too much away. [Go read it](http://amzn.to/1olJJW6) if you're interested in learning more about yourself and your organization dynamics.
