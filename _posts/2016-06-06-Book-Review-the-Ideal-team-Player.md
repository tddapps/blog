title: "Book Review: The Ideal Team Player"
---

As with other Lencioni books [The Ideal Team Player](http://amzn.to/1UlWXv4) is hard to put down once you start reading it. It emphasizes the significative advantage teamwork can bring to a company. The book revolves around the "Humble, Hungry, Smart" model. What is it and how ideal team players should follow it.  

[The Ideal Team Player](http://amzn.to/1UlWXv4) is far from being a theory book. It provides practical applications of the "Humble, Hungry, Smart" model: interview techniques, interview questions, employee assessment and development techniques, techniques to embed the model in the culture.

The book describes several personalities I've encountered during my years working: the Pawn, the Bulldozer, the Charmer, the Lovable Slacker, the Skillful Politician.  

My one sentence summary would be: "Don't hire jackasses. If you keep them for too long then the non-jackasses will leave".
