Like [other Patrick Lencioni books](http://amzn.to/1T2ppr0) [Death by Meeting](http://amzn.to/23qr2hT) is very enjoyable and easy to read. The book is targeted at making your meetings more effective rather than abolishing them altogether.

## Meeting Requirements  
[Death by Meeting](http://amzn.to/23qr2hT) clearly illustrates the necessity of Conflict and Contextual Structure for effective meetings.

**Conflict**: Meeting leaders should mine for conflict out of the participants. They should remember attendees that conflict is good and expected. Conflicts not addressed in meetings can easily become politics.  

**Contextual Structure**: Some meetings should be focused on solving an immediate problem while others should be purely brainstorming. Do not mix meeting structures.  

## Suggested Meetings  
Near the end of the book the author describes the four types of meetings companies should have.

- **Daily CheckIn**: Five minutes standing up. Report current activities.
- **Weekly Tactical**: 45 to 90 minutes. 60 seconds per participant to provide context. 5 minutes of progress review based on key business metrics. Realtime agenda derived from the progress review. Limited to address short term topics.
- **Monthly Strategic**: Deep dive into one or two topics that will impact the business. Two hours per topic. Can be scheduled ad-hoc too for critical issues. Require proper preparation.
- **Quarterly Offsite Review**: Analyze the business in a more complete manner. One or two days. Team and strategy review. Competitors and industry reviews. Aim to improve team unity.

## Summary  

Straight to the point book. Mandatory read for meeting organizers and participants.
