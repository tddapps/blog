title: The Goal and The Phoenix Project
---

These two books are very hard to put down. They both make an emphasis in looking at the big picture and what's relevant for the company as opposed to individual departments.

## Takeaways

- It doesn't matter how hard you work if it's not aligned with the company's goal
- A factory where every station is working at 100% of  its capacity is very inefficient
- The company's velocity is limited by the slowest link in the chain

Written in a very similar style both books favor the idea that asking questions is the only true way of teaching. They both clearly illustrate the importance of cross-team collaboration to impact the company's bottomline.
