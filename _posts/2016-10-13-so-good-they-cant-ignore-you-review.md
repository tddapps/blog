## Control  
Industry leaders usually have significant amounts of control over what they do. They choose **what** to work on and **how** to do things. Control is what many of us crave for. [So good they can't ignore you](http://amzn.to/2en85eW) illustrates several individuals' path to gain control over their careers. **Hint**: None of them followed their passion.  

**Caveat**: Only pursue more control if you have evidence other people are willing to pay for it.  

## Career Capital  
> Career capital are the skills you have that are both rare and valuable and that can be used as leverage in defining your career
