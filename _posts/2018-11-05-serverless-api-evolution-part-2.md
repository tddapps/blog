This is the follow up of [Serverless Api Part 1: From an idea to Production](/2018/10/09/serverless-api-evolution-part-1/). It is not yet complete. You can read about [The HeartBeat Pattern](/2018/10/24/the-heartbeat-pattern/) and some [Thoughts on DynamoDB](/2018/10/06/thoughts-on-dynamodb/) in the meantime.
