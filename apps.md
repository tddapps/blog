Since 2008 we have published _and deleted_ multiple iPhone apps.  
A couple of years ago we decided to adopt [TDD](https://amzn.to/2HPEqJh) for the majority of our software projects.  

## [TDD](https://amzn.to/2HPEqJh) Apps (2014-Present)  

- [Shoe Sizes Converter](/shoes/) was rebuilt from the ground up in 2017. The app leverages In-App Purchases and adapts to multiple screen sizes. An in-depth refresh of modern Swift and its capabilities.  

## Before TDD (2008-2014)  

- [Baseball Stats](http://stats.cash-productions.com) a comprehensive aggregation of unique Baseball Stats. Written in good old `Objective-C` its development predates Swift and `autorelease` pools. This app is currently in maintenance mode.  

## Other apps  

We've built other apps for our clients, they may or may not be directly associated with our brand in the App Store. Moreover, some our first apps were deleted in 2016.
